# Hoppy Home Brewer

Hoppy Home Brewer is a tool that allows users to learn more about the different styles of beer that they can make and the different ingredients that go into beer. When the user logs in or creates a new account they can make and keep track of home brew projects and make changes as they perfect their recipes. If the user needs a little inspiration in their beer planning process, they can play the Random Beer game and get a beer made of random ingredients.

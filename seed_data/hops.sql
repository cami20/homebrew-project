3|Amarillo|Amarillo is a privately grown and registered hop variety; it was introduced recently but has been extremely popular with brewers seeking a Cascade-type hop with a distinctive American character. It is considered by many to be ideal for dry hopping, but also gives a clean bitterness due to low cohumulone content. The flavor has citrus and floral notes, and something like a Cascade character, but with more bitterness. Amarillo is a registered trademark of Virgil Gamache Farms, Inc., where the hop was originally developed.|8|0|6|7|UNITED STATES
4|Bramling|An older variety of Golding, Bramling is rarely if ever available to home brewers under its own name. The original was selected from the field of a farmer named Musgrave Hilton who had a farm in the English town of Bramling. Bramling was once one of the most popular aroma hops in England, but gradually faded as higher-yielding varieties became available. Until recently, it was still grown in small amounts in England and in British Columbia, Canada, where it may be one of the cultivars sold as British Columbia Golding. Bramling also lent its name to one of its progeny, the rare but still available Bramling Cross cultivar.|5|5|2.29999999999999982|3.20000000000000018|UNITED KINGDOM
5|Bramling Cross|Started in 1927 from a cross between a wild Manitoban male hop and a female Bramling hop, a variety of Golding. Used as a general-purpose bittering hop, lately this easy-growing hop has been used to provide a unique fruity, blackcurrant and lemon notes in traditional ales, especially in Christmas ales and cask-conditioned ales. Dry hopping can produce a very interesting effect. Bramling Cross is an under-appreciated hop.|5|0|2.20000000000000018|3.20000000000000018|UNITED KINGDOM
6|Bravo|Bred in 2000 and released commercially for the first time in 2006, Bravo is a proprietary hop variety sold by S.S. Steiner. Bravo is a diploid high-alpha hop derived from a female Zeus and a male derived in part from Nugget. It is reported by Steiner to have excellent resistance to powdery mildew. Bravo has been used in Rogue's 20007 release of their Glen Ale, and was also the featured hop used in every beer in the 2007 Single Hop Festival hosted by Drake's Brewing Company.|14|0|3|4|UNITED STATES
7|Brewer's Gold|A seedling selected at Wye in 1919 from a wild Manitoban hop and released in 1934, Brewer's Gold was one an early bittering hop, grown in England and in the United States (see Brewer's Gold (American)), until the release of new high-alpha varieties in the 1970s and 1980s. It is also an ancestor of most modern high-alpha hops. Some Brewer's Gold is still grown in England, but there is no longer significant production in the United States. Brewer's Gold was never used as an aroma hop in England because of its intense flavors, but has been used experimentally as a dry hop by some American craft brewers.|5.5|0|2.5|3.5|UNITED KINGDOM

9|Bullion|One of the earliest bittering hops, Bullion was created in 1919 by an open pollinated cross between an unidentified English male and an wild Manitoba hop. Unlike modern bittering hops, Bullion has a strong, distinctive character which is perceptible, especially in additions later than 60 minutes. The aroma and flavor characteristics are strong, pungent and sometimes harsh or resiny, with elements of spiciness and a fruit character that has been described as black currant or raspberry. Bullion has become less popular with the wide availability of new bittering hops with better storage characteristics and a more neutral bittering character, but its unique flavor makes it worth considering for home and craft brewers.|6|0|3.20000000000000018|6|UNITED KINGDOM
10|Cascade|Cascade was created in the United States as an open-pollinated cross between Fuggle and Serebrianker. Its instantly recognizable grapefruit, floral aroma is characteristic of many American ales. Cascade is also one of the easiest hop varieties to grow; it can grow well under less than ideal conditions or in short growing seasons, and unlike most varieties, if started from a good rhizome a Cascade can produce a good crop even in its first growing season.|5.5|0|4.5|7|UNITED STATES
11|Centennial|Sometimes called a super Cascade, Centennial was bred in 1974 but not released until 1990. It has a floral, citrus aroma and a clean spicy flavor; its heritage includes Brewer's Gold, Fuggle, and East Kent Golding. Popular among craft brewers, Centennial lends its distinctive character to, among others, Sierra Nevada Celebration Ale and Sierra Nevada Bigfoot Barleywine.|6|0|3.5|4.5|UNITED STATES

It has a clean bittering from relatively high alpha acids and good aroma characteristics. It has a fine fruity aroma with spicy overtones. Like many other varieties developed at Wye, this hop is sometimes known as Wye Challenger, especially in older references. This simply indicates that it was developed at Wye, not necessarily anything about where it was grown.|6.5|0|4|4.5|UNITED KINGDOM

Considerable areas of First Gold are being planned and there is significant interest already from Britain's traditional ale brewers for bittering and for late and dry hopping.|4|0|2.29999999999999982|4.09999999999999964|UNITED KINGDOM
23|Fuggle (American)|Fuggle cultivar hops grown in the United States are not considered as desirable as the true English Fuggles, but they probably retain more of their character than most other transplanted landrace varieties. American growers developed Willamette as a similar but hardier and better-producing hops for American use. Fuggles and related varieties have been used around the world under various names, from Styrian Goldings in Slovenia to Tettnanger in the United States.|4|4|1.5|2|UNITED STATES
24|Fuggle (English)|Fuggle is an English hop cultivar. Sometimes considered an English landrace, Fuggles were seedling selected in England in 1875. The true Fuggle (English) is sometimes considered a noble hop, and while it is sometimes considered inferior to Golding hop varieties such as the famous East Kent Goldings, Fuggle's flavor and mild, spicy, woody aroma are deeply characteristic of English beer. Fuggle has suffered from wilts of late, and has largely been replaced by newer varieties. Fuggle provides a full British style palate and can be used alone, but is often blended with East Kent Goldings. Fuggles and related varieties have been used around the world under various names, from Styrian Goldings in Slovenia to Tettnanger in the United States.|3|3|2|3.10000000000000009|UNITED KINGDOM
25|Galena|Galena is a high-alpha hop variety developed by the Iowa state breeding program in 1968 by open pollination from Brewer's Gold and released to the trade in 1978. Because of its strong, clean bitterness, it is said to be among the most common bittering hops used in America. It is sensitive to growing conditions and can be more difficult to grow outside of the Northwest. Galena has a strong fruity/black currant aroma similar to Bullion.|11|0|7|9|UNITED STATES

31|Hallertau Hallertauer Mittelfruher|Hallertauer Mittelfruher or Hallertauer Mittelfruh is the landrace cultivar of the Hallertau, the premier hop growing region of Germany. When grown in the Hallertau, these hops are properly called Hallertau Hallertauer Mittelfruher, but this is usually shortened to Hallertau Hallertauer. However, homebrewers should be aware that "Hallertau Hallertauer" is also sometimes used to describe other aroma hops grown in the Hallertau, especially Hallertauer Gold. These hops are one of four hops almost always considered to be noble hops, and are much prized, especially by continental European brewers, for their flavor and aroma characteristics. However, because of their extreme susceptibility to verticillium wilt, true Hallertauer Mittelfr?her is disappearing from the Hallertau. This has led to efforts to breed wilt-resistant hops with similar characteristics, to grow the Hallertauer Mittelfruher in areas outside of the Hallertau, especially in Tettnang, Hersbruck, and Spalt, and to grow other aroma varieties in the Hallertau, with the result that the name "Hallertau" or "Hallertauer", once synonymous with this variety, has been applied to so many hop varieties that it sometimes becomes confusing. The true Hallertau Hallertauer Mittelfruher has the mild, pleasantly spicy aroma and flavor described simply as "noble" and characteristic of the great German lagers.|4.09999999999999964|0|4.70000000000000018|4.70000000000000018|GERMANY
32|Hallertau Hallertauer Tradition|Hallertauer Tradition is a German aroma variety, derived from Hallertauer Gold, which was bred as a replacement for Hallertau Hallertauer Mittelfr?her. It combines a flavor said to be similar to Hallertauer Mittelfr?her with significantly improved disease and pest resistance and higher yield. As with Hallertau Hallertauer Mittelfr?her, the "Hallertauer" in Hallertauer Tradition is part of the name of the cultivar, and hops of this cultivar grown outside the may also be referred to as Hallertauer Tradition, although it is sometimes simply called Tradition. However, because this variety is currently grown primarily in the Hallertau, the full name is not generally used, and the hop is generally sold simply as Hallertauer Tradition even if it was grown in the Hallertau.|4|0|3|6|GERMANY
33|Hallertau Northern Brewer|Originally developed in England (see Northern Brewer (British)), this hop quickly became established both in the Hallertau in Germany and, later, in the United States (see Northern Brewer (American)). It is no longer grown in the U.K. in significant amounts. In addition to being a good all-around bittering hop for German-style beers, it is the only hop used in Anchor's Steam Beer, and is often used in other beers of the same style.|7|0|3|5|GERMANY
34|Hallertauer (American)|Small quantities of the true Hallertauer Mittelfr?her cultivar are grown in the United States. However, just as with other Hallertauer hop varieties, it can be difficult to know what exactly you are getting; Hallertauer Gold, Mount Hood, and Liberty, among others, are sometimes sold as "U.S. Hallertauer". Even the true Hallertauer Mittelfr?her is not considered to have a true noble hop quality when grown in the United States.|3.5|0|3.5|5.5|UNITED STATES
35|Hallertauer Magnum|Derived from German hops including Hallertauer Mittelfr?her and Galena, Hallertauer Magnum, sometimes just called Magnum, is a bittering hop cultivar with a clean German flavor and aroma profile, excellent for bittering any kind of German beer. It is one of the most popular bittering hops in Germany, and is also grown in the United States. Because "Hallertauer" is part of the cultivar name and not necessarily an indication of where the hop was grown, you should not assume that all Hallertauer Magnum hops were grown in the Hallertau. Magnum hops sold in the United States are often labeled as "Yakima Magnum"; it is unclear whether this represents a separate cultivar or simply Yakima Valley-grown Hallertauer Magnum.|11|11|5|7|GERMANY
36|Herald|This was developed at Wye as a bittering hop with a better flavor profile than Target.

Like many other varieties developed at Wye, this hop is sometimes known as Wye Northdown, especially in older references. This simply indicates that it was developed at Wye, not necessarily anything about where it was grown. Northdown replaced Northern Brewer in many dark or strong British beers when it was released in 1970, including some Dry Stouts. Its distinctive flavor helped it survive in many beers even after the introduction of cleaner, higher-alpha varieties such as Target. Today it is sometimes sold under the name of "Northern Brewer (Northdown)", although the two cultivars are distinct.|6|0|3.60000000000000009|6.20000000000000018|UNITED KINGDOM

56|Pride of Ringwood|Pride of Ringwood was bred in Australia from the English hop Pride of Kent, possibly by means of crossing with a wild Tasmanian hop. Although its 7-10.5% alpha acid level has been eclipsed by later-developed hops, when it was released in 1965 it was the highest alpha acid hop in the world. An even higher alpha version, Super Pride, was later developed by Australian hop breeders. Pride of Ringwood quickly became the predominant Australian hop, accounting for about 90% of the country's hop production. The vines are vigorous growers. Pride of Ringwood has a distinct citrus aroma that is strong and somewhat coarse but still pleasant; it is quite distinctive, especially in late additions, and accounts for the unique character of many Australian beers, including Foster's lager.|7|0|4|6|AUSTRALIA
57|Progress|A cross between Whitbread Goldings Variety and a wild North American hop, Progress has moderate bittering power along with great aromatics.

59|Saaz (Czech)|Saaz, now known as Zatec, is the name of a city noted for its hop production. Historically, hops from Saaz (?atec) were considered among the finest in Europe, and were the backbone of the original Bohemian Pilsner; ?atec (Saaz in German) is in the area in NW part of Bohemia of the modern-day Czech Republic. In brewing, Saaz usually refers to the hop cultivar traditionally associated with Saaz and Bohemian Pilsner. Although the traditional name for this hop would be Saazer (or Saaz Saazer when grown in the Saaz area), it is generally simply referred to as Saaz or Czech Saaz. zech Saaz is grown not only in ?atec area but also in Tr?ice area (Central Moravia) and ?st? n/L area (North Bohemia). Saazer hops are also grown in other countries. Saaz grown outside of the Czech Republic will have different characteristics and will generally be identified by their nation of origin: for example, Saaz (American). True Saaz Saazer hops are prized for their mild, pleasant flavor, and are the only choice for brewing an authentic Pilsner.|3|0|3|8|CZECH REPUBLIC

64|Spalt Select|Spalt Select, sometimes called Spalter Select, was released in the late 1980s by the German hop breeding program at H?ll. The goal of Spalt Select was to reproduce the classic noble hop character of the Spalt Spalter landrace in a more easily grown hop. Spalt Select was reportedly chosen by Anheuser-Busch to replace Spalt Spalter and Tettnang Tettnanger hops in some of their recipes. Some Spalter Select hops available to American homebrewers may be labeled simply as "Spalt" or "Spalter", but in fact Spalt Select is not the same cultivar as Spalt Spalter or even a closely related cultivar; it is a triploid derived primarily from Hallertauer Mittelfr?h. Since "Spalt" or "Spalter" is part of the hop's name, hops grown anywhere may be sold as "Spalter Select." In fact, in addition to Spalt, much commercial production of Spalt Select takes place in the Hallertau. Some growers are currently growing Spalt Select as an organic hop.|3|0|2.5|6.20000000000000018|GERMANY
65|Spalt Spalter|Usually considered one of the classic noble hops, Spalt spalter is the landrace hop of Germany's Spalt growing region, closely related to Saaz Saazer and Tettnang Tettnanger. Today some Spalter hops are also grown in other parts of Germany and marketed simply as Spalt. Spalt Spalter has a mild, spicy aroma that is often compared to Czech Saaz or Tettnang Tettnanger. Can be used in any beer calling for a noble hop. Because of the poor growing characteristics of this hop, Spalt Select, a hop claimed to have similar flavor and aroma but better growing characteristics, was released by the German hop breeding program at H?ll in the 1980s, and is now grown extensively both in Spalt and in the the Hallertau.

69|Styrian Goldings|Styria is a traditional hop-growing region on the modern-day Austrian/Slovenian border, and hop farms can be found on both sides of the border, although in modern times this variety is more closely associated with Slovenia and is sometimes called Savinja Goldings after a river in Slovenia. Although referred to as Styrian Golding, this hop is actually genetically derived from Fuggle rather than Golding hops. At one time the less desirable Fuggles were exported to some areas as "Fuggle Golding," which is probably the source of the name. This hop became the primary hop grown in Styria in the 1930s when their other landrace varieties were severely damaged by powdery mildew. Because it is genetically derived from Fuggle, it is not surprising that Styrian Goldings also resembles Fuggle in character, with a pleasant spicy aroma.|3|0|1.80000000000000004|4.09999999999999964|AUSTRIA
70|Summit|The first hedgerow (dwarf) hop variety to be grown commercially in the United States, and the first to be available to home hop growers as a rhizome, Summit is perhaps the strongest bittering hop available based on early crops. Because of its recent origin, it is not clear how it will develop in large scale commercial production; the numbers given are based on a few early crops. Summit has strong orange/tangerine citrus notes in aroma and flavor and its growers also suggest it as a good candidate for dry hopping. It was also the featured hop used in every beer in the 2006 Single Hop Festival hosted by Drake's Brewing Company.|17.5|0|4.70000000000000018|4.70000000000000018|UNITED STATES

73|Target|An early British high-alpha hop, at one point Target accounted for 40% of all U.K. hop production. Admiral, recently released as a proposed replacement, is considered to have a less harsh, more pleasing bitterness.|8|0|4.29999999999999982|5.70000000000000018|UNITED KINGDOM
74|Tettnang Tettnanger|Universally recognized as a noble hop, Tettnanger is the landrace of Germany's Tettnang hop-growing region. Only Tettnanger hops grown in the Tettnang should be referred to as Tettnang Tettnanger. It is prized for its spicy, floral noble character, and is genetically very similar, if not identical, to the Saaz cultivar grown in the Czech Republic. Hops described as "Tettnanger" are also grown in the United States, Switzerland, and Australia, but these American Tettnanger, Swiss Tettnanger, and Australian Tettnanger hops are generally not be the true Tettnanger cultivar, but are thought to be Fuggle or a descendant of Fuggle. Since "Tettnanger" cultivation is traditional in Switzerland, it is most likely that these Swiss "Tettnanger" were never Tettnanger hops to begin with, but that rhizomes were exported under that name. In recent years, a few growers have tried growing true Tettnanger hops in the United States, but because of the confusion of names, these are almost impossible to find or identify.|3.5|3.5|3.5|5|GERMANY
75|Tettnanger (American)|American hops sold as Tettnanger hops often claim to be the same cultivar as the famous German aroma hop Tettnang Tettnanger. However, in recent years, it has been discovered that these hops are genetically distinct from the German landrace and in fact are most likely Fuggle or a closely related hop. The most likely explanation is that American hop growers imported the so-called Swiss Tettnanger hops, which may also have been Fuggle hops misrepresented as Tettnanger for marketing purposes. In recent years, a few growers have tried growing true Tettnanger hops in the United States, but because of the confusion of names, these are almost impossible to find or identify.|4|0|3|4|UNITED STATES
76|Ultra|A triploid released in 1983 as part of a program attempting to develop an American substitute for European aroma hops, Ultra was derived from a tetraploid Hallertauer and a Saaz-type hop. Sister hops from the same program include Liberty, Crystal, and Mount Hood. Unlike its half-sisters, which tend to resemble Hallertauer and other German hops, Ultra retains a Saaz-like character and is recommended as a domestic substitute for Saaz in Bohemian pilsener and other lagers where Saaz is characteristic.|4.5|0|3.60000000000000009|4.70000000000000018|UNITED STATES

80|Whitbread Goldings Variety|Variously known as Whitbread Goldings Variety, Whitbread Golding Variety, Whitbread's Golding, or simply W.G.V., this hop is not a true Golding hop variety, but a seedling of Bate's Brewer. W.G.V. provides a distinctive sweet fruit flavour in beers, similar to, but generally more pronounced and robust than, Goldings. It gives a mild, clean bitterness in traditional ales, and is sometimes used with good effect as a distinctive dry hop with a fruity, mild and clean flavor. Used perhaps still in Archer's Bitters, Bellhaven's ale, and Young's.|5|0|2|3.29999999999999982|UNITED KINGDOM
81|Willamette|Released from the U.S.D.A. hop breeding program in 1976, Willamette is a triploid (some sources say tetraploid) seedling of Fuggle bred to be easier to grow in the United States. It's still less vigorous than most modern hop varieties, but easier to grow in most areas than the very fussy Fuggle. Willamette has a mild, grassy, floral and slightly spicy aroma similar to Fuggle, and is often used as a substitute, especially in the United States where Fuggle does not grow well. Willamette is extensively planted in the U.S. Pacific Northwest.|4|0|3|4.5|UNITED STATES
82|Yakima Cluster|Yakima Cluster was derived from Late Cluster, which in turn was derived from Pacific Coast Cluster. One of several other Cluster hop varieties often sold simply as "Cluster." "Yakima" is part of the name of this cultivar, and not simply an indication of the growing region.|5.5|0|4.5|5.5|UNITED STATES

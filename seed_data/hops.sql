It is considered by many to be ideal for dry hopping, but also gives a clean bitterness due to low cohumulone content. The flavor has citrus and floral notes, and something like a Cascade character, but with more bitterness. Amarillo is a registered trademark of Virgil Gamache Farms, Inc., where the hop was originally developed. | 8 | 0 | 6 | 7 | UNITED STATES
Bramling | An older variety of Golding, Bramling is rarely if ever available to home brewers under its own name. The original was selected from the field of a farmer named Musgrave Hilton who had a farm in the English town of Bramling. Bramling was once one of the most popular aroma hops in England, but gradually faded as higher-yielding varieties became available. Until recently, it was still grown in small amounts in England and in British Columbia, Canada, where it may be one of the cultivars sold as British Columbia Golding. Bramling also lent its name to one of its progeny, the rare but still available Bramling Cross cultivar. | 5 | 5 | 2.29999999999999982 | 3.20000000000000018 | UNITED KINGDOM
Bramling Cross | Started in 1927 from a cross between a wild Manitoban male hop and a female Bramling hop, a variety of Golding. Used as a general-purpose bittering hop, lately this easy-growing hop has been used to provide a unique fruity, blackcurrant and lemon notes in traditional ales, especially in Christmas ales and cask-conditioned ales. Dry hopping can produce a very interesting effect. Bramling Cross is an under-appreciated hop. | 5 | 0 | 2.20000000000000018 | 3.20000000000000018 | UNITED KINGDOM

Brewer's Gold | A seedling selected at Wye in 1919 from a wild Manitoban hop and released in 1934, Brewer's Gold was one an early bittering hop, grown in England and in the United States (see Brewer's Gold (American)), until the release of new high-alpha varieties in the 1970s and 1980s. It is also an ancestor of most modern high-alpha hops. Some Brewer's Gold is still grown in England, but there is no longer significant production in the United States. Brewer's Gold was never used as an aroma hop in England because of its intense flavors, but has been used experimentally as a dry hop by some American craft brewers. | 5.5 | 0 | 2.5 | 3.5 | UNITED KINGDOM

Bullion | One of the earliest bittering hops, Bullion was created in 1919 by an open pollinated cross between an unidentified English male and an wild Manitoba hop. Unlike modern bittering hops, Bullion has a strong, distinctive character which is perceptible, especially in additions later than 60 minutes. The aroma and flavor characteristics are strong, pungent and sometimes harsh or resiny, with elements of spiciness and a fruit character that has been described as black currant or raspberry. Bullion has become less popular with the wide availability of new bittering hops with better storage characteristics and a more neutral bittering character, but its unique flavor makes it worth considering for home and craft brewers. | 6 | 0 | 3.20000000000000018 | 6 | UNITED KINGDOM
Cascade | Cascade was created in the United States as an open-pollinated cross between Fuggle and Serebrianker. Its instantly recognizable grapefruit, floral aroma is characteristic of many American ales. Cascade is also one of the easiest hop varieties to grow; it can grow well under less than ideal conditions or in short growing seasons, and unlike most varieties, if started from a good rhizome a Cascade can produce a good crop even in its first growing season. | 5.5 | 0 | 4.5 | 7 | UNITED STATES

Challenger | A granddaughter of Northern Brewer developed at Wye, Challenger is a classic true dual purpose hop and one of the most popular English hops of the 1980s and 1990s. It has a clean bittering from relatively high alpha acids and good aroma characteristics. It has a fine fruity aroma with spicy overtones. Like many other varieties developed at Wye, this hop is sometimes known as Wye Challenger, especially in older references. This simply indicates that it was developed at Wye, not necessarily anything about where it was grown. | 6.5 | 0 | 4 | 4.5 | UNITED KINGDOM
